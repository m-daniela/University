<!-- Solve the following task using only the jQuery library (production version, jquery.min.js, or developement version, jquery.js); YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE ANY OTHER JS LIBRARY, PLUGIN OR EXTENSION BESIDES THE JQUERY LIBRARY. Write a web page which displays a horizontally sliding desktop like the ones used on the Android or iOS. The web page should have 4 desktops, each desktop having a distinct transparent background color or image and having distinct textual and image content. A desktop is a large div occupying (exactly or almost) the whole browser window. By default, desktop no. 1 should be shown to the user. If the user clicks somewhere on the desktop the desktop should be slided horizontally to the right and from the left desktop no. 2 should slide horizontally and occupy the whole browser window. Desktop sliding should be an animated transition and one desktop should not just instantly dissapear and the next desktop be displayed instead. -->

			<h1>Birch</h1>
			<p>A birch is a thin-leaved deciduous hardwood tree of the genus Betula (/ˈbɛtjʊlə/), in the family Betulaceae, which also includes alders, hazels, and hornbeams. It is closely related to the beech-oak family Fagaceae. The genus Betula contains 30 to 60 known taxa of which 11 are on the IUCN 2011 Red List of Threatened Species. They are a typically rather short-lived pioneer species widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in northern areas of temperate climates and in boreal climates.</p>

			<h1>Oak</h1>
			<p>An oak is a tree or shrub in the genus Quercus (/ˈkwɜːrkəs/; Latin "oak tree") of the beech family, Fagaceae. There are approximately 600 extant species of oaks. The common name "oak" also appears in the names of species in related genera, notably Lithocarpus (stone oaks), as well as in those of unrelated species such as Grevillea robusta (silky oaks) and the Casuarinaceae (she-oaks). The genus Quercus is native to the Northern Hemisphere, and includes deciduous and evergreen species extending from cool temperate to tropical latitudes in the Americas, Asia, Europe, and North Africa. North America contains the largest number of oak species, with approximately 90 occurring in the United States, while Mexico has 160 species of which 109 are endemic. The second greatest center of oak diversity is China, which contains approximately 100 species.</p>
