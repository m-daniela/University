lab 1 - html

Create a single HTML web page for a subject you like (e.g. personal home page, photo collection, movie stars, cars etc.). You can NOT use any CSS or Javascript on your web page! Only basic HTML language. The web page should be HTML5 valid. You will have to use the following HTML tags in your web page: <img>,<a>,<table>,<br>,<hr>,<p>,<b>,<div>,<ul>, <li>,<section>,<article>,<footer>,<header>,<aside>,<nav>, <svg>,<audio>,<video>,<figure>,<figurecaption>,<main>.
